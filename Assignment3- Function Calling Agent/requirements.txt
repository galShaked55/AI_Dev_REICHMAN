# README â€“ AI Development Assignment #3: Function Calling Agent
# ------------------------------
# ** Please See 'partners.txt' file for authors.
# Description:
# This assignment uses OpenAI's function calling to build an agent-based system that:
#   1. Processes various file types (text, CSV) using 6 specialized tools
#   2. Executes multi-step queries requiring different tools in sequence
#   3. Generates outputs like JSON files, plots, and data analysis
#   4. Automatically logs all tool usage and maintains execution history
#
# Required Files:
#   - hw3.py                   # Main function calling agent application (entry point)
#   - input.json               # Input file specifying query and resources
#   - <query_name>.txt         # Query text file (name specified in input.json)
#   - File resources           # Data files (names/descriptions in input.json)
#
# Setup Notes:
# - The application expects all input files to be in the working directory specified and hardcoded in the main loop.
# - By deafult, the application expect the initial 'input.json' to be located in the same directory as the 'hw3.py' code.
# - Azure OpenAI credentials must be set as environment variables:
#   * CLASS_OPENAI_API_KEY
#   * SUBSCRIPTION_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_4o
# - Furthermore, hw3.py expects credentials to be specified in file named 'environment_variables'
#   Located in current directory.
#
# Output Files Generated:
#   - <query_name>.log          # Detailed execution log with tool entry/exit
#   - Generated Python programs # When plot generation tools are used
#   - Generated PNG plots       # When visualization is requested
#   - JSON files               # When data analysis outputs are requested
#   - Text files               # When write_file tool is used
